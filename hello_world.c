#include <stdio.h> // Include stdio.h Header File for basic function in C called "printf()"


// Notes:
// 1. The "int" keyword before the "main()" function states that the "main()" function will return an integer value
// 2. The first lines of code which will be run will always reside in the "main()" function
// 3. If the integer value 0 is returned, the function has run successfully.  If a value greater than 0 is returned, then there were problems with the code inside the function
int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!");
  return 0;
}
